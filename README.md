# Calculator
Just picked up JavaScript again, took a break from coding and started working on my arduino project (which is still coding, I'm planning on uploading my arduino project to here soon), so I decided to make a calculator to make sure I still remember everything, I believe there's room for improvement, style wise, but I rather move on and start new projects.
